# CAR-GAME
This is a car modification/ specific car buying game which i made in OOP for my semester project along with my group partner. The technologies i used in the project are
•	Class
•	Functions
•	Polymorphism
•	Inheritance
•	If Else
•	File Handling
•	Windows.h
File handling saves the car make model varient horsepower everything in a single file, you can save multiple cars in the same save file too
